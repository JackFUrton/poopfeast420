#1 - UnitConversion.java - 10 points

Write a Java program to convert from US units to metric units.

Your user will have 3 options in a main menu

Length
Volume
Temperature
The length option will offer the user the option of converting from inches to centimeters or from centimeters to inches.

The volume option will offer the user the option of converting from gallons to liters or from liters to gallons

The temperature option will offer the user the option of converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius or from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The table of conversions is below.

You are to do a functional decomposition here – at the very least have methods for input, for processing and for output.  The goal here is for main() to be self-documenting.  Follow the examples from class.

You may choose to use JOptionPane for input and output as demonstrated in class.

All output should be well-formatted.

 

 

A run of your program might look like this (if you were using System.out.println and Scanner) – user input is shown in red:

Conversion options:

Length
Volume
Temperature
Which conversion would you like to perform? 1

You have chosen length conversion.

Conversion options:

Inches to centimeters
Centimeters to inches
Which conversion would you like? 2

Enter the number of centimeters : 5

5 centimeters is equal to 1.968505 inches

 

 

Conversion Table

Convert from

Inches to centimeters and reverse

1in = 2.54cm

0.393701 in  =   1 cm

Gallons to liters and reverse

1 gallon = 3.78541 liters

0.264172 gallons = 1 liter                  

Temperature Fahrenheit to Celsius and reverse

Celsius  = (fahrenheit – 32) * 5 / 9

fahrenheit = Celsius   * 9/5 + 32

 

#2 WarYears.java - 7 points

Write a Java program to determine the name of the war that was happening at the time the user requests.

The user will be requested to input a year.  Your program will determine and output the name of the war that was happening at that time.  Use the War Chart below for determining the war during the year input.

Again, good functional decomposition is required here.  Even if you are tempted to put all tasks in one method, do not do it!  One method for input, one method for processing, one method for output.

A sample run of your program might look like this (if you were using System.out.println and Scanner) – user input is shown in red:

Which year? 1920

There was no war going on in 1920.

A second run might look like this:

Which year:  1915

World War 1 was happening in 1915.
